# Hearthstone optimal mana curves

Mana curves in Hearthstone can be characterized by (1) how mana efficient they are, and (2) how many (mana efficient) plays the player has available each turn.

Here, we compute a Pareto front of optimal mana curves. Mana curves on the Pareto front are not dominated by other mana curves in terms of objectives (1) or (2), and can in a sense all be considered optimal.
